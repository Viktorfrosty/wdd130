        <h2>Victor Malpica</h2>
        <p>Glad to see you here. I'm a part-time adventurer and a full-time student. I became a jack of all trades because I like to learn new things and put them into practice shortly after I feel comfortable with the information I gathered through various sources. That is why I am very skilled with pastry.</p>
        <P>A bit of my backstory. I was part of an expedition team for five years, and during my time with that group, I fell in love with nature, animals, and trekking. The majority of my ex-team members were students in the computer science area. I owe them so much, especially my earliest interactions with computer programming and software development. Nowadays, I am a part of the B.Y.U. Idaho online program to get a degree and be part of the sea of possibilities and innovations that characterize the applied technologies area.</p>
        <p>Also, I've been a member of the L.D.S. Church for almost a year. I can tell you it has been a crazy year, and I love it because I finally found my perspective about life. During the general conference in October of 2022, I heard the speech that became my motivational pillar for a better future: "Building a Life Resistant to the Adversary." By Elder Jorge F. Zeballos. That speech showed me the way to bear the weight of the problems I face every day.</p>
        <p>Have a good day, and God bless you!</p>
