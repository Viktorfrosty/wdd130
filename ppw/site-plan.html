        - Mysteryverse
      </p>
      <p>
        Mysteryverse is a captivating roguelike deck builder game that blends elements of magic and mystery in a unique setting that combines the medieval and modern eras. In this game, you could be a mage or a non-mage navigating in a world where the mundane and the magic collide. The environment is a surreal blend of medieval castles and modern cityscapes, where knights in shining armor coexist with soldiers in tactical armor, and ancient spells meet modern technology. Your primary weapon is a deck of cards, each imbued with spells or abilities. As you progress through the game, you’ll have the opportunity to collect and upgrade these cards, building a deck that suits your playstyle. The game’s roguelike nature means that each run is different. The layout of the world, the enemies you encounter, and the cards you can collect change with each playthrough, offering endless replayability. The game’s mystery element comes into play as you uncover the secrets of the world’s past. Unravel the threads of time, discover hidden truths, and make choices that will shape the flow of the history. With its gameplay, minimalistic visuals, and lore, Mysteryverse offers an immersive gaming experience that will challenge and delight fans of deck builders and roguelikes alike. Whether you’re casting spells in a medieval-like dungeon or hacking systems in a modern metropolis, every moment is filled with magic and mystery.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Upper block</p>
      <p>
        My name is Victor Malpica. I describe myself as a part-time adventurer and a full-time student. Years ago, I was part of an excursion team, and during my time with that group, I fell in love with nature, animals, and trekking. The majority of my ex-team members were students in the computer science area. I owe them much, especially my earliest interactions with video game programming and software development. Some people call me the jack of all trades because I like to learn new things and put them into practice as soon I feel comfortable with the information I gather through various credible sources; that is why I am very skilled with pastry. Recently, I left behind my survival gear and started baking cakes and doing pastries for a living. In my free time, I program modifications of games for personal use; these side projects have been useful for me because I am honing my programming skills and expanding my knowledge about video game engines.
